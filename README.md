## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass

### What I learned

Added Sass as a new tecnology over the last challenge. Felt a lot more comfortable working with Sass than with plain CSS, mainly because of partials.

```CSS
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

This snippet to make the card stay in the middle.

### Continued development

Next challenges i'll try to incorporate Tailwind or Bootstrap.

### Useful resources
